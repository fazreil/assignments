### What are the research questions and objectives?
Research Questions
* What do software managers, project managers, and agile coaches in agile software environment think about the use of DDD to improve software development productivity?
* How do software managers, project managers, and agile coaches in agile software environments currently use descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, and predictive analytics, or knowledge creation, retention, accumulation, and transfer to improve software development productivity?
* How do software managers, project managers, and agile coaches in agile software environments think descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, prescriptive analytics and predictive analytics, or knowledge creation, retention, accumulation and transfer could be used to improve software development productivity?
* What obstacles do software managers, project managers, and agile coaches in agile software environments think their organization needs to overcome to improve software development productivity?
---

### What were the areas covered in the literature review?
* software
* software development productivity
* agile software
* analytics
* knowledge management
---

### Comment on how the literature review was carried out.
The literature review was conducted in such way that a thorough article search was performed in various repositories. Each keywords was used in combination to get a collection of item for review. The vast collection was then filtered out where irrelevant items were discarded.

### Were there any conceptual model used? Explain the conceptual model.
Yes, conceptual model was used as part of the research. The conceptual model focuses on process. Three key items that defines a process was explored; people, tools and procedure.

### Explain any specific theory that was used as a basis for this research.
Data Driven Decision (DDD) Making theory 
* Brynjolfsson et al. (2011) equated DDD to “data and business analytics” 
* DSS (Hedgebeth, 2007)  
* business intelligence (BI) according to Ivancenco, Boldeanu, and Mocanu (2010) 
* both DSS and BI (Ow & Morris, 2010)  
* competitive intelligence (CI) according to Bartes (2011) 
 
Business Intelligence 
> BI is “the process of transforming data into information and then into knowledge. Business Intelligence systems are specialized tools for data analysis, queries and reporting, that support management in the decision-making process” according to Ivancenco et al. (2010, p. 51). BI is intended to improve strategic decision-making rather than to improve daily tactical decision-making.  
 
Knowledge Management (KM) 
> KM is about “people, process, and technology” (Molaei, 2011, p. 426); however, small organizations may benefit from sharing knowledge with other organizations by developing common knowledge repositories. 
 
DDD is related to KM because DDD requires knowledge creation, accumulation, retention, and transfer. 
 
This qualitative research study is intended to begin to fill this gap in the literature by exploring management’s understanding of DDD a tool to improve software development productivity in an agile software environment.

### What was the methodology used for this research?
Population

1. Data collection  
Qualitative research study - Interview 
 
2. Data analysis plan 
IPA data collection and analysis process  
IPA Steps: 
1. The first interview transcription was read and reread to understand the 
meaning of the whole interview. Extraneous information was identified and 
unique statements that describe how the research participant’s experienced the 
phenomenon was identified. 
2. Comments were made on the interview content including comments on the 
linguistics and the concepts conveyed.  
3. Themes within the interview were identified. 
4. Patterns were identified between the emergent themes 
5. Steps 1-4 were repeated for the remaining interviews 
6. Patterns were identified across the interviews 
7. The results of the analysis was interpreted based on the themes identified, the 
comments made within each interview, and the literature.  
 
Code categories for qualitative data: 
* Organizational 
* project setting 
* Process 
* perspectives 
* Substantive 
* subcategories of the organizational categories  
* describe the research “participants’ concepts and beliefs”  
* Theoretical 
* more abstract framework  
* evolve from the data analysis process 
* represent the researchers thinking

### What were the research methods used?
The research methods used is qualitative research. The author conduct a series of in-depth interviews. Interviewees include software managers, project managers and agile coaches. 

---
### What was used to analyze the data?

---
### What was concluded by this research?
Software development productivity may be improved if organizations use DDD to determine what to build and how to build it.  
Software development productivity may be improved if organizations use DDD to transition from a command and control culture to a culture that supports agile software development.  
Based on the results of this research, software development productivity may be improved if organizations use DDD to ensure the stakeholders have a common understanding of agile software development methods.

### What avenue did this research have for future research of the same area?
Additional research outside the United States or with different operational definitions for KM and analytics may reveal new insights into how DDD could be used to improve software development productivity.  
Additional research that included software developers, business analysts, and other agile software development team members could reveal different results. 
Additional research that purposefully selected research participants based on project size could add to the knowledge on how DDD improves software development productivity in an agile software development environment.  
Additional research is needed to empirically determine the correlation between DDD and software development productivity in an agile software development environment.  
Additional research could be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of KM tools that incorporate analytics to improve software development productivity.
