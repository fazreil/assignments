[Abstract|
Processes to develop and deliver software have been evolved over the years. One of the primary motivations 
of this evolution, is gaining the beneﬁts of shorter time-to-market. Continuous deployment is a recent 
trend to deploy software to the customers automatically and in continuous fashion. Organizations adopting 
this trend could reach the customers faster through quick deliveries and improve the quality and productivity 
of the delivered product by an early feedback, and hence achieve increased customer satisfaction. Complex 
software intensive industrial systems are large-scale, distributed over heterogeneous platforms and interact 
with several sensors and actuators. Enabling continuous deployment for these industrial systems needs 
a stable deployment process able to cope with domain speciﬁc requirements and challenges. Notably, the 
required quality attributes of the deployed software product as well as the challenges introduced by 
the customer-speciﬁc nature of the domain. In this thesis, we formalize continuous deployment for industrial 
systems by identifying the main factors of an appropriate deployment process. In particular, we investigate 
high-level requirements, required quality attributes of the software product, and challenges in the deployment.
 Based on this, we propose a continuous deployment pipeline and a set of activities incorporated in the 
 stages of the pipeline, in particular deployment and post-deployment stages. Moreover, we suggest automation 
 support for the activities to both shorten the delivery time and to preserve repeatability and reliability 
 of the deployment process. The aim of such a process is to maintain the quality attributes of the deployed 
 software. We perform a case study to validate the proposed model by implementing a prototype in an industrial system
