[Abstract|
Aiming to provide the means for efficient collaboration between development and operations personnel, 
the DevOps paradigm is backed by an increasingly growing collection of tools and reusable artifacts for 
application management. Continuous delivery pipelines are established based on these building blocks by 
implementing fully automated, end-to-end application delivery processes, which significantly shorten 
release cycles to reduce risks and costs as well as gaining a critical competitive advantage. Diverse 
application environments need to be managed along the pipeline such as development, build, test, and 
production environments. In this work we address the need for systematically specifying and maintaining 
diverse application environment topologies enriched with environment-specific requirements in order to 
implement continuous delivery pipelines. Beside the representation of such requirements, we focus on their 
systematic and collaborative resolution with respect to the individual needs of the involved application environments.
