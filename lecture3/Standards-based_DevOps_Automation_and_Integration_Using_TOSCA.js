[Abstract|
DevOps is an emerging paradigm to tightly integrate developers with operations personnel. This is required 
to enable fast and frequent releases in the sense of continu- ously delivering software. Users and customers 
of todayâ€™s Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and 
feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Beside 
cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to implement DevOps in practice, tooling is required 
to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration 
and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is con- stantly pushing 
new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all 
these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to 
integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud. In this paper we present a systematic 
classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be transformed toward 
TOSCA, an emerging standard in this field. This enables the seamless and interoperable orchestration of arbitrary artifacts to model and deploy application topologies.We validate the presented approach by a prototype implementation, show its practical feasibility by a detailed case study, and evaluate its performance
