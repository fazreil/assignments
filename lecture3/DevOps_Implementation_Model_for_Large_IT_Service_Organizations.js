[Abstract|
Within the research, the implementation of DevOps is approached as a change in the business process 
of  an  organization.  Business  process  change  models  are  therefore  used  to  develop  a theoretical
conceptual  model for  the  research.  Based  on literature  research,  a combination of  a  business 
process reengineering framework and the elements of lean six sigma are chosen as in that way both top-down and 
 bottom-up  approaches are  included.  The  categories  of  this  model  are  business  process,  people, 
technology,  information,  organizational  culture  and  structures  in  which  multiple  DevOps  aspects  are 
categorized. The conceptual model is a general model for a change towards DevOps based on literature.
To make the model specific for large IT service organizations, empirical research has been done at such 
organizations. Nine  cases  are  described  by  conducting case interviews  with  IT  managers  of  large  IT 
service organizations. The empirical data consist of in sights on the current implementation and focus of 
organizations towards DevOps aspects. First of all, it is confirmed that there is no consensus in defining 
DevOps. Organizations and people are all defining DevOps differently, although the starting point of 
research that states that DevOps is a cultural movement is evaluated as correct.
After concluding this, the research definition of DevOps is used during the whole research to create the same 
starting point. The empirical results show per category an indication of aspects that are relevant for DevOps, aspects 
that would be nice to have, aspects that already implemented due to an Agile way of working and aspects 
that are not DevOps specific within large IT service organizations. The results alsoindicate a certain 
ranking in which the aspects can be placed although this order can differ per organization. Next to 
the case interview results on the model, additional findings during those cases related to DevOps aspects 
and   related   to   the   implementation   are   summarized.   Most   additional   findings   related   to   the 
implementation process are evaluated by an expert evaluation session in order to analyze its correctness. The 
conclusions of the case interviews together with the conclusions of the expert evaluation session provide  a  
clear  overview of  all  important  aspects  that are  relevant  for  large  IT  service  organizations regarding 
an implementation of a DevOps way of working.
