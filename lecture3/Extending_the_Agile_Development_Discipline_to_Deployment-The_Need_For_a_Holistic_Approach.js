[Abstract|
In the last decade information system development has made a shift towards the agile way of working. 
Agile teams are responsible for realizing requirements in a multidisciplinary set up, where business 
and development are represented in a single project. DevOps is a new movement to improve IT service delivery 
agility. DevOps fosters closer collaboration and communication between development and operations personnel.
Until recently, operational issues and requirements remained underexposed in the project, which affected 
the quality of the software. DevOps aims to break down the functional silos and extends the scope of 
the project to the release deployment. In this thesis we propose an incremental method engineering approach 
to identify suitable process patterns for a Dutch IT organization, and be able to implement them into 
Scrum. The resulting method increments are sequentially implemented during an 8-week pilot project to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of DevOps practices on the experienced problem areas.
