[Abstract|
Commonly used open source configuration management systems, such as Puppet, Chef and CFEngine, allow 
for system configurations to be expressed as scripts. A number of quality issues that may arise when  
executing these scripts are identified. An automated quality assurance service is proposed that identifies 
the presence of these issues by automatically executing scripts across a range of environments. Test 
results are automatically published to a format capable of being consumed by script catalogues and social 
coding sites. This would serve as an independent signal of script trustworthiness and quality to script 
consumers and would allow developers to be made quickly aware of quality issues. As a result, potential 
consumers of scripts can be assured that a script is likely to work when applied to their particular 
environment. Script developers can be notified of compatibility issues and take steps to address them.
