## Assignment 2 

### Part 1 (5 marks): Answers are inline with itallic font

#### Write a list of key terms that relate closely to your research project (e.g. ‘Knowledge acquisition’, ‘‘event driven, ‘crime detection, IT outsourcing, etc.) 
> DevOps (Development Operations),
> Software Configuration Management, 
> Build Engineering,
> Continuous Integration,
> Continuous Delivery,
> Agile Software Development principle

#### What academic fields best lend themselves to your subject and perspective for research?E.g Knowledge management. 
> Software Engineering

#### What are the specific knowledge areas of this academic field that will best help in exploring and defining the research subject?E.g knowledge management in university. 
> DevOps in Software Engineering, with specific interest in Continuous Integration and Continous Delivery.

#### What knowledge and competency do you have in this field?E.g Course taken, work experience and access to research sample 
> I have set my career path in pursuing DevOps for the last 8 years. It was a evolution of a principle known as Software Configuration Management. Back then Software Configuration Management 

#### What further knowledge will you have to acquire to have a solid foundation to address this interest?e.g university document management process, dashboard research. 
> Research on different implementation of DevOps across various software development. This include their strategy on Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
       
### Part 2: 
Find 10 closely related papers to your research, examine the material to decide its relevance and how could these data help you to refine/elucidate the key words of your research statement? Produce a table as per example below (20 marks):

Edvinsson & Sullivan (1996)|Developing a Model for Managing Intellectual Capital|Although there has been an explosive interest in an intellectual capital and a thirst for information on how it might be managed, there has been little written to describe or define the concept.|Knowledge firm|This article provides background and definition to the notion of intellectual capital and describes where and how it fits into the 'knowledge company'. 
Haider, Z. (2017) | Continuous Deployment for Complex Software Intensive Industrial Systems.	| Complex Software Intensive Industrial Systems require stable deployment process with attention to requirement and challenges. Improving delivery of Complex Software Intensive Industrial System takes careful setup of continuous delivery system. The Continuous Delivery system will focus on three main factors namely high level requirements, required attribute of software product, and challenges in deployments	| Industrial Systems |The article discusses the development of software delivery pipeline that manage to shorten time while preserving repeatability and reliability of the deployment process.
