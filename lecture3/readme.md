Find 10 closely related papers to your research, examine the material to decide its relevance and how could these data help you to refine/elucidate the key words of your research statement? Produce a table as per example below (20 marks): 



No.| Author/years| Title 	| Theory/Standpoint	| Domain 	| Significant Findings 
---|---------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------------
1 |Haider, Z. (2017) | Continuous Deployment for Complex Software Intensive Industrial Systems.	| Complex Software Intensive Industrial Systems require stable deployment process with attention to requirement and challenges. Improving delivery of Complex Software Intensive Industrial System takes careful setup of continuous delivery system. The Continuous Delivery system will focus on three main factors namely high level requirements, required attribute of software product, and challenges in deployments	| Industrial Systems |The article discusses the development of software delivery pipeline that manage to shorten time while preserving repeatability and reliability of the deployment process. 
2 |Jonker, M. (2017) | DevOps Implementation Model for Large IT Service Organizations | DevOps as a business process change is implemented through the understanding of six sigma elements. The challenge is developing DevOps process is that each organization implements it differently. To deliver the best approach in implementing DevOps the model takes consideration on business  process,  people, technology,  information,  organizational  culture  and  structures pillars of each organizations. | IT Service Organizations	| The Business pillars which are the basis of the implementation of DevOps model are all relevant in each scenario. However the dynamic nature of them suggests some building blocks for the implementation of DevOps; external drivers, component with its aspects, implementation approach, and critical organizational factors.
3 |R. Feitjer (2017)|Towards the adoption of DevOps in software product organizations: A maturity model approach | DevOps is in its infant stage and not formally defined. Semi structured interviews and literature reviews are used to construct a model to assess maturity of DevOps organizations. In strengthening the finding, two rounds of validation were carried out before putting them into case studies. Where it describes various levels of maturity.		| Software Development 	|Six drivers and 63 capabilities were identified to define the maturity of DevOps implementation. These capabilities are grouped into three perspectives. All of them are used to gauge the competency in DevOps implementation.
4 |Wetinger, J et. al (2015) |Enabling DevOps Collaboration and Continuous Delivery Using Diverse Application Environments | Continuous Delivery is the latest paradigm that perform rapid releases by using DevOps to pull synergies between applications from different environment.	Diverse application environments need to be managed along the pipeline such as development, build, test, and production environments| Continuous Delivery			|Continuous Delivery pipeline is established by tailoring custom automation system incorporating various DevOps tools. With it a systematic end to end system that caters all environment is set up to handle a dynamic delivery process.
5 |Virmani, M. (2015)	| Understanding DevOps & bridging the gap from continuous integration to continuous delivery| Delivery lifecycle of an organization is seldom lacking efficiency. Putting DevOps into its places across SDLC would make Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery work in an automated manner where the organization benefits from efficiency and business needs.	| IT Organization	|Diving head first into DevOps is a risky move therefore there are various consideration need to be evaluated before adopting DevOps
6 |Russo D. (2016)	| Benefits of Open Source Software in Defense Environments | Open source software seldom considered due its open nature is surprisingly a good choice of technology stack in defense environment. Open source software bring a lot of benefit like reducing cost of implementation, enhanced security, maintainability and reliable. Leveraging from the array of open source softwares stack, devops and agile methods deliver more benefit from various aspects. Rapid releases and lesser probability of errors lead to better performing software 	| Defense Organization	| Leveraging from Open Source Software, agile and devops methods lead to reduction of both design and technical debts.
7 |Djikstra O. (2013) | Extending the Agile Development Discipline to Deployment The Need For a Holistic Approach	| DevOps opens up new ground in extending Agile Development Discipline. It break up functional silos while extend scope of project release and deployment. It also makes both requirements and operational issues meets. The benefit of agile is taken up to the next level by enabling the project team to identify suitable process patterns and also improve IT delivery agility. | IT Software Project			| DevOps leverages agile principle practises by fostering closer communication and collaboration, enabling richer effort fostered and efficient process improvement.
8 |Wettinger, J. (2014) | Standards-based DevOps Automation and Integration Using TOSCA	| Users and Customers expect fast feedback to issues and feature requests, therefore developers and operations personnel work must integrate tightly to deliver software frequent and continuously. End to End automation of deployment process involve putting in the best tools. While the implementation differs from one to another a standard known as TOSCA enables seamless and interoperable orchestration of artifacts to model and deploy application topologies.	| IT Companies	| Using a detailed case study, TOSCA standardization manage to perform well in its prototype
9 |Meyer, S. (2013) | Quality Assurance for Open Source Software Configuration Management |Software quality is compromised when there are descrepancies in testing environments. Common open source configuration management systems is used to manage these environments with opportunity to morph an environment into another. Trustworthyness and quality of the software is certain with enabling end to end testing procedure where one output is consumed by another configuration facility to shape up the right environment.	| Software Testing	| Script developers are able to get near instant feedback when the automated testing platform is diligent to understand the configuration nature of the test.
10|	Ashfaque A. et Al (2015) | Synthesizing Continuous Deployment Practices Used in Software Development | Continuous Deployment now play an important role in software process. Continuous Deployment speeds up process of various agile methods of software development. Major software companies has implemented continuous deployment to the extend it can contribute to software practitioner to take in the practise to analyse. Various software practise from a number of software companies are analysed.				| Software Deployment	| Continuous Deployment impose a consistent use of automated testing and deployment with regular code review. It puts them as integral part of sound software engineering.

From the 10 papers: 
#### What would be your conclusion? (5 marks) 
> DevOps enables both continuous integration and continuous deployment, which make huge impact on software engineering process. DevOps bridges the shortcoming of previous software development methods. 
#### What is the evidence that supports the conclusion? (5 marks) 
> The papers discusses about delivering a good software from implementing DevOps in various domain. A maturity model is even developed by Feitjer to gauge how a software organization is performing. Djikstra takes DevOps as the next thing in line after perfecting agile principle in software project. Most of large IT companies has started to shift their current practise to implement DevOps.
#### What areas has been overlooked/neglected? (5 marks) 
> The Software Development from the Startup scene is neglected
#### What would be the argument of your thesis? (5 marks) 
> DevOps is a practise not exclusive to large IT companies. Startups can benefit from the opportunities DevOps are bringing. Lacking from a few aspect such as resource and infrastructure is the difference that separates small IT startups from large IT companies.
#### What premises from the literature was used as a basis for your argument? (5 marks) 
> 
#### Write your research problem in two (2) or three (3) paragraphs. Write your problem statement in not more than 250 words. (10 marks)
